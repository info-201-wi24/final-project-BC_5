# Introduction
Electric vehicles (EVs) have recently emerged as a frontrunner to addressing the environmental impacts of using fossil fuels for transportation. Despite this however, falling consumer demand, slowing production and other woes have continued to plauge this new market. To better understand EV adoption rates and the factors influencing consumers' decision to switch to EVs, we analyzed datasets on EV charging station availability in Washington State, along with car registrations with the Washington State Department of Transportation get a better picture of what is possibliy happening.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
As it turns out, areas with higher amounts of charging capacity such as Chelan and Clallam are correlated with higher EV adoption as well. Although with this data along causation cannont be proven, this vaulable visualzation can help provide insight on where to start looking.
